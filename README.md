# Forest and Mice Data neural network analysis
In this project, a custom implementation of Logistic Regression and Back-propagation for Multilayer Perceptronâ€™s (MLP) is being applied to two datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
The first dataset (Data Set 1) is a Mice Protein Expression Dataset which has 8 unique classes and 77 variables. 
The second dataset (Data Set 2) is a Forest Type Dataset which has 4 unique classes and 27 variables. 
With this information in mind, exploratory data analysis (EDA) followed by modeling and analysis was done to determine if applying 
the two above mentioned techniques can assist in properly classifying the data based on selected attributes.
